# These pre-commit hooks don't ensure a passing CI run. Instead they act as
# a quick "smoke check" running static code analysis on the files changed.
# The hooks do NOT:
#     - Run tests or other time-consuming tasks.
#     - Check the whole codebase, just modified files.
#     - Run flake8 extensions.
#     - Allow mypy to look for missing imports (mypy runs with `ignore_missing_imports=True`).
